# MoonBoard-ML
ML model for predicting the difficulty of MoonBoard climbs using FSDL (fullstackdeeplearning.com) best practices

Planned project structure:

Code quality assurance with pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, and pytest
Real data augmented with data synthesis
Grading diifficulty via a Transformer architecture
Model implementation in PyTorch
Model training and basic tracking and metrics via PyTorch Lightning and torchmetrics
Experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and model versioning with W&B
Model packaging in TorchScript
Predictor backend containerization via Docker and deployment as a microservice on AWS Lambda
Basic load testing with Locust
Pure Python frontend web application in Gradio
Model monitoring with Gantry
